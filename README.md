## Dataset

- **Source:** The project utilizes a dataset containing information about movies, including budgets, genres, release years, and box office earnings.



## Data Cleaning and Preparation

- The dataset is cleaned, missing values are handled, and relevant features are selected for analysis.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- EDA involves exploring the dataset to understand its characteristics, distributions, and relationships between variables.

- Visualizations provide insights into movie budget trends, genres, and release patterns.

## Statistical Analysis

- Statistical techniques quantify relationships between variables, such as budget and box office earnings.

- Hypothesis testing and correlation analysis help uncover significant associations.

## Visualizations

- Visualizations include histograms, scatter plots, box plots, and more.

- Graphs visualize correlations, trends, and patterns in movie budgets and performance.

## Key Findings

- The analysis reveals insights into the budget's impact on movie success, genre preferences, and trends.

- Findings provide a deeper understanding of the movie industry dynamics.
